Medical Query Answering System
This project is a Medical Query Answering System that utilizes a Retrieve and Generate (RAG) approach to answer user queries based on a dataset related to medical data (such as lung cancer). The system leverages Groq's API for generating responses and Sentence Transformers for encoding textual data into embeddings for efficient retrieval.

Key Features
Medical Query Processing: Users can input questions related to medical data, and the system will retrieve the most relevant information from a dataset.
Embedding Generation: Uses the Sentence Transformers library to convert the dataset into embeddings, enabling semantic similarity-based retrieval.
Groq's API Integration: The system uses Groq's Llama model to generate detailed and relevant answers based on the user's query and retrieved data.
Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the system and enter queries through a user-friendly web interface.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have the necessary dataset (dataseter.csv) uploaded in the repository or a directory accessible by the app. You can upload the CSV file to GitHub and link it using the raw URL.

Run the app:

bash
Copy
streamlit run app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to interact with the query answering system.

How it Works
Dataset Loading: The application loads a dataset that contains medical data (e.g., lung cancer-related data) from a CSV file (hosted on GitHub or locally).

Embeddings Creation: Each row in the dataset is processed into text form, and embeddings are generated using Sentence Transformers. These embeddings help identify similarities between user queries and the dataset.

Retrieving Relevant Data: The system compares the embeddings of the user query with the dataset embeddings using cosine similarity to find the most relevant rows.

Text Generation with Groq: The retrieved rows are used as context for Groq's Llama model to generate a detailed response to the user's query.

User Interaction: The system provides an interactive Streamlit interface, allowing users to input queries and receive answers directly from the model.

Example Usage
Open the app in your browser.
Type a medical-related question into the input field (e.g., "What is the survival rate for lung cancer?").
The system will retrieve relevant rows from the dataset and use Groq's API to generate a detailed response.
The answer will be displayed in the Streamlit interface.
Dependencies
pandas: For data manipulation and reading the dataset.
numpy: For numerical computations.
sklearn: For calculating cosine similarity between query and dataset embeddings.
sentence-transformers: For generating sentence embeddings.
groq: For interacting with Groq's API to generate text-based responses.
streamlit: For building the interactive web interface.
To install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Example of the Dataset
Here is an example of how the dataset (dataseter.csv) might look:

Patient ID	Age	Diagnosis	Stage	Treatment	Survival Rate
001	56	Lung Cancer	2	Chemotherapy	60%
002	63	Lung Cancer	3	Surgery	40%
003	50	Lung Cancer	1	Radiotherapy	80%
